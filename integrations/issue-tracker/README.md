# GitHub issues ↔ Atomic kanban

A two-way sync for one repository and one ordinary Atomic kanban table. Provider
code (`adapter.ts`, `tracker-actions.ts`) stays here.

This folder also holds the plugin's other issue sources:

- `devonian/github-issues/`: the in-browser Devonian GitHub issues lens and
  bridge (moved from the `devonian` package; see its README).
- `todoist.ts`: the read-only LocalThought projection of Todoist tasks onto
  an issue list (moved from `integrations/localthought/`), with
  `todoist.test.ts` and the recorded-fixture check `todoist-fixture.test.ts`.

## Mapping

| GitHub                                    | Atomic      |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Issue title                               | Card title  |
| Markdown body (`null` becomes empty text) | Description |
| Open, without `atomic:doing`              | Todo        |
| Open, with `atomic:doing`                 | Doing       |
| Closed                                    | Done        |

Dragging a card to Done closes its issue; moving it back reopens it. Other labels
are preserved: the adapter adds/removes only `atomic:doing`, never replaces the
whole label set. Create that label in the test repository before using Doing.
Pull requests are excluded. Comments, assignees, milestones, GitHub Projects and
issue deletion are outside this first scope. A missing issue/card is a conflict,
not permission to delete the other side.

## Verification

```sh
./browser/node_modules/.bin/vitest run --config integrations/issue-tracker/vitest.config.ts
./browser/node_modules/.bin/tsc -p integrations/issue-tracker/tsconfig.json
```

These check `adapter.ts`'s pagination, PR exclusion and mapping, the generic
event-to-JavaScript starter (`automation.test.ts`), the Todoist projection, and
every test under `devonian/github-issues/`. The latter import the `devonian`
package from source, so install its dependencies first
(`cd devonian && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`).
